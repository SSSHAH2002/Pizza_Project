# Pizza_Project
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using PostgreSQL for data storage and querying, and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization. It provides insights into sales performance across different time periods, pizza categories, and locations.

*Database Integration:

Imported and normalized raw sales data into PostgreSQL database.
Designed relational schema with appropriate data types and constraints.
Wrote SQL queries to clean, transform, and aggregate data (e.g., total revenue, sales per category, top-selling pizzas).

*Data Analysis in SQL:

Calculated KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, most profitable category.
Time-series analysis: monthly and weekly sales trends.
Used GROUP BY, JOIN, CASE, and CAST statements for analytical queries.

*Interactive Dashboard in Power BI:

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL database.
Created visuals: bar charts, line graphs, slicers, KPI cards, and pie charts.
Enabled dynamic filtering by pizza category, date range, and product.
Designed an intuitive layout for non-technical users.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights:

Identified peak sales months and most popular pizza types.
Discovered high-profit categories and underperforming products.
Enabled data-driven decision-making for marketing and inventory.
